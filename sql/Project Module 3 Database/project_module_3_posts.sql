INSERT INTO `posts` VALUES (2,'Keeping Your Canine Companion Cool: Essential Heat Safety Tips For Dogs','<p>We can always count on summer to bring the heat. But as the temperature rises during the hot summer months, it&rsquo;s important to remember our furry family members can easily overheat. Our pups rely on us to keep them safe and comfortable, and understanding how to protect them from excessive heat is crucial. Here we&rsquo;ll explore essential heat safety tips to ensure your canine companion stays cool, happy, and healthy throughout the summer.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>1. Ensure Water Is Always Available</strong></h2>\r\n<p>H<sub>2</sub>0 is the way to go in keeping your dog hydrated and regulating their body temperature. Always provide fresh, cool water in multiple locations within your home and outdoor spaces. When heading out for walks or adventures, carry a portable water bottle&nbsp;and a collapsible bowl to offer your dog regular drinks. If you&rsquo;re spending extended periods outdoors, consider using a cooling vest or bandana that can be soaked in water to provide additional relief from the heat.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>2. Avoid Excessive Exercise</strong></h2>\r\n<p>While exercise is vital for a dog&rsquo;s overall wellbeing, it&rsquo;s important to adjust their activity levels during hot weather. Engage in outdoor activities during cooler times of the day, such as early mornings or evenings. Pavement and sand can become scorching hot and cause burns to your pup&rsquo;s sensitive paw pads. Test the ground&rsquo;s temperature by placing the back of your hand on the surface for 10 seconds&mdash;if it&rsquo;s too hot for you, it&rsquo;s too hot for your dog.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>3. Provide Ample Shade</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Create shaded areas in your yard or patio where your dog can retreat from direct sunlight. While shade doesn&rsquo;t change the air temperature, it can reduce the surface temperature. Utilize umbrellas, canopies, or trees to offer them protection. Keep in mind that the position of the sun changes throughout the day, so ensure there is always a shaded spot available for your dog&rsquo;s comfort.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>4. Never Leave Your Dog in a Parked Car</strong></h2>\r\n<p>The inside of a parked car can quickly become a death trap for dogs, even on moderately warm days. Within minutes, the temperature inside a car can rise to dangerous levels, causing heatstroke or even death. Even with the windows cracked, it is never safe to leave your dog unattended in a parked car. (It&rsquo;s even illegal in some states!) If you must run errands, leave your furry friend at home in a cool, well-ventilated space.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>5. Recognize the Signs of Heatstroke</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Heatstroke is a severe condition that requires immediate veterinary attention. Knowing the signs can save your dog&rsquo;s life. Watch for excessive panting, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, drooling, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, or disorientation. If you suspect your dog is suffering from heatstroke, move them to a cool area, apply a cool (not cold) wet towel to their body, and seek veterinary help immediately.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>6. Be Mindful of Breeds Prone to Heat Sensitivity</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Certain dog breeds are more susceptible to heat-related issues due to their anatomy or coat. Brachycephalic breeds like bulldogs, pugs, and shih tzus are particularly vulnerable due to their shortened airways. Long-haired or thick-coated dogs may also struggle in hot weather. Take extra precautions with these breeds by providing them with cooling mats, using fans or air conditioning, and grooming them to remove excess fur.</p>\r\n<p>A little extra care and attention can go a long way in keeping your furry friend cool, happy, and healthy all season long. If you&rsquo;re looking for an easy way for your pup to beat the heat, find a Dogtopia near you&nbsp;and take advantage of our supervised, climate-controlled indoor playrooms.</p>','https://www.helpguide.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Health-Benefits-of-Walks-with-Your-Dog-1200x800.jpeg','Admin',2,3,'2023-10-11 14:19:48','2023-10-19 10:10:21'),(3,'Dog-safe Greens Your Pup Will Enjoy','<p><span data-contrast=\"\\&quot;auto\\&quot;\">Give your dog some safe greens to enjoy in celebration of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day!

However, as is the case with insurance for humans, there are many plans to choose from, and finding the most suitable option can be a difficult task if you are unsure of the pet insurance landscape.</p>\r\n<p>Determining what works best for your pup, as well as your family&rsquo;s lifestyle, is key. To help you navigate, we have outlined some of the top components of pet insurance that you should know before deciding on a plan.</p>\r\n<h3>1. Different Types Of Pet Insurance</h3>\r\n<p>While there can be some modifications between pet insurance companies, plans typically fall into two categories &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>accident-only and accident-illness</strong>.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Accident-only</strong>&nbsp;plans cover accidents that your pup might get into that cause an injury and require care. This can include a broken bone, swallowing an object, a cut or wound, etc. As a result, pet insurance can cover the associated treatment costs for the injury, such as an emergency vet visit, X-rays, bloodwork, medications, surgery, and so on. Opting for this plan means no other pup-related costs are covered other than what is directly associated with the accident.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Accident-illness&nbsp;</strong>plans, which can also be called comprehensive coverage, cover everything listed in an accident-only plan, with the addition of illnesses or infections. This means if your pup develops a health concern or catches a virus, the related costs to test and treat them are covered. This type of plan can also cover chronic illness and hereditary health issues but may have some additional requirements, depending on the condition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>2. What Pet Insurance Does Not Cover</h3>\r\n<p>One of the most important things to remember about pet insurance is that it will only cover the costs of accidents, illnesses or medical issues that occur&nbsp;<strong>after</strong>&nbsp;the insurance comes into effect. That means if your dog has a pre-existing health issue that was diagnosed prior obtaining the insurance plan and it requires treatment, pet insurance will not cover those costs.</p>\r\n<p>You will also not likely find basic pet insurance plans that cover vet checkups or wellness visits, spaying/neutering, vaccinations or other types of preventative care. But, continue reading to learn about insurance add-ons.</p>\r\n<h3>3. Insurance Add-ons (aka Riders)</h3>\r\n<p>Anything you add to your pet insurance plan is called a rider. These paid additions can help fill in the gaps of your original coverage for things you think your pup might need or that you want to be covered for, just in case. For example, dental treatment is a common rider, as you will not usually find this type of treatment in an original insurance plan. You can also find riders that cover annual vet checkups, wellness-related services, treatments and some preventative medications that are not already covered in a plan (i.e., for ticks, mites, and fleas).</p>\r\n<h3>4. Factors That Can Impact Pet Insurance Costs</h3>\r\n<p>This will largely depend on the insurance company, but there are some pet insurance plans that specifically state certain limitations depending on the breed of dog. For example, if your pup is a breed which is known for certain health concerns, some pet insurance companies will charge a higher premium simply for this reason. There are also some plans that exclude certain breeds altogether.</p>\r\n<p>Another factor that could impact insurance rates is the age of your dog. The older they are, the greater the likelihood they will need more treatments or can be prone to illnesses, thus requiring you to pay more of a premium, which can increase each year. As well, some pet insurance plans do not accept dogs after a certain age, which is why it is always recommended to get pet insurance as early as possible for your pup.</p>\r\n<p>You may also find that the size of your dog can raise your premium (larger dogs are often more expensive), where you live can also impact your rates and coinsurance may play a role. Coinsurance is the percentage you are required to pay, not including the deductible, after your insurance plan reimburses part of your costs. For example, if your insurance covers 70% of the treatment, you are required to pay the remaining 30%. This can play a role in how much you are required to pay as a premium.</p>\r\n<h3>5. Pet Insurance Plans Have Deductibles</h3>\r\n<p>A deductible is what you are required to pay prior to the insurance kicking in. Depending on the pet insurance company, you may need to pay a larger amount for your pup&rsquo;s accident or illness care/treatment before the insurance coverage can come into effect.</p>\r\n<p>Paying a higher deductible can translate to a lower premium, which can help if you are looking to keep costs low month to month. Pet insurance deductibles can range in cost and land anywhere from $100 to $1000. This is why it is important to do your research and compare pet insurance companies to find one that best aligns with your budget. While a $0 deductible may seem like a great choice, as it means coverage can begin immediately, your monthly premium could be very high.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to note that a deductible is an amount that you are required to meet&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;you receive coverage from your insurance, and this will often renew yearly. This means if you pay for an emergency treatment that is $300, and your required deductible is $300, you will not have to pay any more of your deductible after that point, as you have already met the requirements. This differs from the balance you are required to pay&nbsp;<em>after</em>the insurance coverage goes into effect, as your insurance will likely not cover 100% of the costs, and you will be required to pay the remaining out of pocket.</p>\r\n<h3>6. A Waiting Period</h3>\r\n<p>Some pet insurance companies have a waiting period in place before coverage can begin. Be sure to carefully read this part of your policy, as you may be waiting around longer than anticipated for coverage, even if you already have met your deductible. It is always best to find a plan that offers little to no waiting period, especially if your dog is getting older or you happen to have a larger breed who may be more susceptible to health concerns down the line.</p>\r\n<h3>7. Finding The Right Pet Insurance For You And Your Pup</h3>\r\n<p>You can never expect the unexpected, which makes opting for pet insurance a great, and often necessary choice for your pup. Discovering a plan that works best for your budget while also offering the right amount of coverage is key, so don&rsquo;t be hesitant to customize a plan that checks all your boxes. With different coverage tiers and riders available to add to your plan, you can personalize one that works for you and your beloved furry family member.</p>\r\n<p>Dogtopia has worked with petted.com&nbsp;to create a handy comparison tool that can help you choose the right pet insurance plan for you and your pup.&nbsp;</p>','https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dog-pet-quotes.jpeg','Admin',2,3,'2023-10-11 14:52:27','2023-10-19 10:09:56'),(5,'What Is Covered When Buying Dog Insurance?','<p>Dogs are furry family members, and their health and wellness are important to pet parents. While we hate to think of something ever happening to them, it&rsquo;s a good idea to plan for the unexpected. The cost of an emergency vet bill is not always affordable, which is why obtaining pet insurance now can help during a stressful time in the future. As inflation continues to increase the cost of veterinary care, pet insurance premiums are likely to increase. Now more than ever,&nbsp;it&rsquo;s important to shop around!&nbsp;Carefully comparing coverages, rates and restrictions will help in finding the right insurance plan for your budget.</p>\r\n<p>Pet insurance is on the rise. Recent data&nbsp;from the North American Pet Health Insurance Association (NAPHIA) suggests the total insured dogs in the U.S. grew by 26.5% in 2021, bringing the total of dogs insured in the United States to 3.251 million and growing. However, despite the recent rise in pet insurance coverage, NAPHIA still estimates that only 2.48% of all pets in the US are covered, leaving many pet owners vulnerable to unexpected costs of keeping their dog fully protected. The peace of mind and security that comes with a comprehensive pet insurance plan is becoming increasingly important amidst a backdrop of financial uncertainty.</p>\r\n<p>Obtaining dog insurance can be very comforting, but as you begin your search, it is necessary to understand what is typically covered and what isn&rsquo;t. Of course, coverage will vary depending on the plan and provider, but here is a list of what is commonly covered.</p>\r\n<h3>Emergency Vs. Routine Care</h3>\r\n<p>Typical pet insurance plans cover the medical costs of unexpected, emergency care. If unfortunate instances arise like your dog eats something they are not supposed to or gets into an accident, your pet insurance will step in and cover some or all of the costs. However, a routine trip to the vet, for example, is not something a plan (without riders) will cover.</p>\r\n<p>And while we are on the topic of what would not be covered, any pre-existing conditions that were diagnosed prior to the insurance taking effect are not covered by most insurance plans. Therefore, if your dog requires medication for an issue they have had for some time, insurance will likely not cover it. Accordingly, any elective treatments, food and toys, or grooming services, for example, would also not be covered. Be sure to read exactly what is and is not covered by your plan before proceeding. That way, there are no surprises.</p>\r\n<h3>Illness And Medical Coverage</h3>\r\n<p>While insurance will not cover a health condition that was previously evident, it will cover an unexpected illness (i.e., dental illnesses, hip dysplasia, cancer, etc.), as well as chronic diseases diagnosed while covered by insurance (i.e., heart conditions, arthritis, etc.). If tests need to be performed on your pup for an illness/disease or an unexpected injury, such as blood work or x-rays, this can also be covered. Accordingly, certain medications can be included if they are prescribed to treat the unexpected illness/injury. If your dog needs surgery, as long as it is not needed for an illness your dog had before the insurance, it can be covered.</p>\r\n<p>Getting your dog insured as early as possible will yield greater results later, as the less pre-existing health conditions they have before insurance, the more that can be covered if they happen to develop something in the future.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to note that most dog insurance plans will not cover spaying and neutering services, vaccinations or preventative care. While related to their health, it would not be categorized under emergency or unexpected.</p>\r\n<h3>Accident-only Vs. Accident-illness Plans</h3>\r\n<p>The coverage provided by dog insurance differs depending on the company and the plan. However, there are two common types of insurance plans &ndash; accident-only and accident-illness.</p>\r\n<p>Aptly named, accident-only plans will cover the costs of unexpected accidents. This may include Insect bites causing illness, falling, a sprain &ndash; these are the types of incidents that you don&rsquo;t expect, and this type of plan can cover part of or all of the associated costs. Accident-illness plans cover everything the accident-only plan covers with the addition of illness coverage. If your dog develops an illness after receiving insurance, the care, treatment and tests that go along with the illness are included in this plan type.</p>\r\n<p>Which is better? If your dog&rsquo;s breed is prone to more illnesses, obtaining an accident-illness plan could be a better option. But if budget is a concern, your dog already has a health condition (which would become ineligible for coverage), or you are looking to insure multiple furry family members and want to keep payments as low as possible while still receiving coverage for unexpected injuries, accident-only plans can be a good choice.</p>\r\n<h3>Wellness Plans</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to an accident-illness plan, there can be an option to include wellness care, which can cover some of the treatments the other plans cannot. For example, a routine visit to the vet to get vaccinations or even a dental cleaning may be covered with a wellness plan. This would act as a separate plan from your existing insurance, but it can be used together, if desired.</p>\r\n<p>A wellness plan, either on its own or added to an accident-only or accident-illness plan, can be a good option if you are a new pet parent and know you will make frequent trips to the vet for vaccinations or routine dental cleanings. Part of a wellness plan can include routine care add-ons, which can provide additional coverage that pet parents can encounter at routine vet visits.</p>\r\n<h3>Riders</h3>\r\n<p>Including an add-on to your pup&rsquo;s insurance is called a &lsquo;rider&rsquo; and this can supplement some of the gaps your plan may have. While a rider will increase your premium, which is the amount you pay monthly, considering your add-on options can offer some reassurance that certain treatments can be covered that wouldn&rsquo;t typically be in your original plan.</p>\r\n<p>A wellness plan, which we discussed previously, is a common rider because it can cover much more of the costs that accident-only and accident-illness plans can. For example, if you are concerned about covering the costs if your dog ever requires flea and tick treatment, a wellness rider would come in handy to take care of the medication costs.</p>\r\n<h3>The Importance Of Pet Insurance</h3>\r\n<p>As a responsible pet parent, you want what is best for your furry friend. If the cost of an unexpected illness or accident seems unmanageable, dog insurance can be a great choice. Molding an insurance plan that fits you and your pup&rsquo;s needs (current and future) is key. While we can&rsquo;t look into a crystal ball and know what your pup will need and when they will need it, obtaining dog insurance as soon as possible can offer the reassurance that you&rsquo;ll be able to care for your dog&rsquo;s health and wellbeing without too much financial burden.</p>\r\n<p>We know keeping your dog happy and healthy is a top priority and pet insurance is a smart move for pet parents.

When a dog attends Dogtopia daycare, they will walk upwards of 30,000 steps per day &ndash; that&rsquo;s three times more than that of a dog who spends their day lounging at home!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dogs are family and we want them to remain in our homes for as long as possible. As pet parents, we must focus on their health to ensure they live a long, happy and fulfilled life. In addition to the food you feed them, make sure you&rsquo;re incorporating regular exercise and activities to keep their overall wellness in check. Dog daycare is a great way to ensure your dog is getting the physical and mental fitness they crave in a fun and safe environment. When your dog spends the day at Dogtopia, we&rsquo;re putting their wellness first through exercise disguised as play, loads of socialization with their BFFFs (Best Furry Friends Forever) and plenty of interaction with our caring team!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://s3-prod.dogtopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RT_MG_8519-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"How Many Steps Does Your Dog Take Every Day? - Dogtopia\"></p>\r\n<p>Regular exercise is beneficial for your dog as it promotes heart health by lowering blood pressure which gives dogs more energy and alleviates the risks of depression and obesity. While keeping our dog&rsquo;s heart healthy is crucial, regular exercise also leads to improved behaviors which may otherwise be exposed during bouts of anxiety. Excessive licking, barking, digging, and chewing are likely to not be as prominent if a dog receives daily exercise such as a walk outside, fetch in the yard or regular daycare at Dogtopia. While at Dogtopia, your dog will spend the day playing with other like-minded pups which allows for the word &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; to become obsolete. At Dogtopia, traditional &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; becomes never ending fun and tons of games!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dogtopia dogs partake in a variety of activities that don&rsquo;t even feel like traditional exercise!

Luckily for dogs, many of the festive foods we enjoy during the fall season can be prepared in a way so they can enjoy them alongside us and are high in vitamins and minerals, too! The list below is filled with items you and your pup can enjoy together to welcome fall and kick off a wholesome and tasty holiday season!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>1.&nbsp;Pumpkin&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be fall without pumpkin for all! Pumpkin is packed with fiber, Vitamins A, C, and E, iron and potassium and low in calories which makes it an ideal snack when temperatures begin to drop. Pups with digestive issues can greatly benefit from enjoying pumpkin, too. Whether you&rsquo;re whipping up your dog&rsquo;s favorite fall snacks or adding a dollop to their food, pumpkin is a fall favorite for pups and pet parents alike.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When purchasing pumpkin, be sure to note the pumpkin is plain without any spices or added sugars to not upset a dog&rsquo;s stomach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/hivti1x80euy/24fDeYxNkVYUAsFfXjZNBA/fc2182732bdf145225c690d6d78b3b37/shutterstock_1245710461.webp\" alt=\"What Fall Foods Can My Dog Eat | Petfolk\"></p>\r\n<h2><strong>2.&nbsp;Carrots</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Raw, unseasoned carrots are a nutritious and low calorie snack your dog will love. Carrots are in season in the fall and support your pup&rsquo;s vision and heart health. Chewing raw carrots is also great for your dog&rsquo;s teeth and gums.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When allowing your dog to enjoy carrots, please remember to serve them unseasoned, preferably raw and&nbsp;cut into bite-sized pieces.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>3.&nbsp;Peanut Butter</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Pups love peanut butter! Packed with fiber and protein, peanut butter is a great snack to add to food or to a few DIY homemade treats. Some of our favorite recipes are made with peanut butter! Check out a few of our favorite recipes!</p>\r\n<p>When preparing a peanut butter snack, ensure there is no xylitol in the peanut butter as xylitol is incredibly toxic and harmful to&nbsp;dogs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>4.&nbsp;Green Beans</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Looking for a healthy treat swap your dog will love? Green beans are a great alternative to store bought dog treats and are packed with Vitamins A and C, iron, and protein, making it a healthy snack that supports your furry friend&rsquo;s immune system and blood health.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When preparing green beans for your dog, ensure they are free of spices or cooking oils because this veggie is best served fresh on its own!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>5.&nbsp;Apples</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Satisfy your pup&rsquo;s sweet tooth with a fresh apple treat! Apples are an excellent low-calorie snack filled with Vitamin A, antioxidants, and fiber which promotes digestive health. In addition to internal benefits, apples can also assist in keeping your dog&rsquo;s teeth clean and breath smelling fresh.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dogs should never be given a whole apple to enjoy. Instead, wash and cut the apple into slices and remove the core and seeds. Washing the apple will prevent your dog from ingesting any pesticides found on the apple&rsquo;s skin and removing the core and seeds will prevent choking hazards and make the treat easy to digest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>6.&nbsp;Cranberries</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Some dogs love them, and some dogs think their flavor is too tart to handle, but cranberries are a great treat for our furry family members. Whether fresh, dried, or cooked, cranberries are ideal for boosting your dog&rsquo;s urinary health.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Holiday favorites such as cranberry juice and cranberry sauce are high in sugar and may include ingredients that are unsafe for&nbsp;dogs. If you want to reward your pup with a cranberry snack, please ensure there are no additives which could upset your dog&rsquo;s stomach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>7.&nbsp;Turkey</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Turkey is a fall favorite, especially around Thanksgiving! Packed with nutrients and protein, turkey is sure to be enjoyed by all. Although dogs may want to enjoy the whole turkey, it is best to give them pieces in moderation as to not upset their stomachs. When deciding which pieces to feed your pup, offer only white meat from the turkey rather than fat, skin, or dark meat as these fattier pieces can lead to upset stomachs and even acute pancreatitis. Be cautious if planning to sneak your dog a few table scraps from the Thanksgiving table, the garlic, onion and other seasonings used to cook the turkey can upset your dog&rsquo;s stomach and turn a joyous holiday into a stressful one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Avoid giving your dog turkey bones as a special treat. These bones may splinter in your dog&rsquo;s stomach and cause internal bleeding or an intestinal blockage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>8.&nbsp;Sweet Potato</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Sweet potatoes are great for digestion and are filled with vitamins such as Vitamin A and other minerals which help fight disease and infection while promoting healthy skin, eyes and coat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When preparing a sweet potato treat for your dog, keep butter, spices and other harmful ingredients out of your recipe as pups enjoy sweet potato best when fully cooked and served plain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Before modifying your dog&rsquo;s diet in any way, please speak with your veterinarian to ensure your dog will react well to these diet changes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58f7b03ec534a5d6fffb0175/1609786369874-2VFD955V7AH0VQZ1FJWB/AdobeStock_88453642.jpeg?format=1500w\" alt=\"Can Dogs Eat Potatoes? &mdash; Veterinarian in Junction City | Animal Care Clinic\"></p>\r\n<h2><strong>9.&nbsp;Foods To Keep Out Of Reach Of Dogs</strong></h2>\r\n<p>The holidays wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without sweets! Desserts including chocolate should&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>be enjoyed by&nbsp;dogs as chocolate is toxic and may harm your pup. Sugary foods of any kind may upset your dog&rsquo;s stomach. To keep your dog healthy and in shape this holiday season, reward them with healthy snacks from the list above to keep them healthy and lively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>10.&nbsp;Enjoying Fall At Dogtopia</strong></h2>\r\n<p>As the weather starts to drop, the playrooms at Dogtopia are always the perfect temperature so dogs can enjoy the benefits of daycare all year long.

It&rsquo;s a great place for dogs to learn positive behavior, practice their skills, get out all their energy, and learn how to be in a new environment with new people and other dogs, ultimately reducing separation anxiety. Dogtopia&rsquo;s environment was designed with dogs&rsquo; wants and needs in mind, and our caring team will make sure your dog always has the Most Exciting Day Ever while in our care. Learn more about the benefits of Dogtopia and how regular attendance at our dog daycare can improve your dog&rsquo;s quality of life (and yours, too!).</p>\r\n<h2>1. Improves Socialization</h2>\r\n<p>All dogs at Dogtopia must successfully pass a Meet &amp; Greet evaluation. This way, we can make sure they are comfortable in our open-play environment and up to date on all required vaccinations. Pet parents can have peace of mind knowing their dog is playing with other like-minded dogs. Once in the playroom, dogs will start to get the lay of the land and introduce themselves to the other dogs around them. We guarantee they will make friends and find plenty of BFFFs (Best Furry Friends Forever). Even if you have a shy dog, regular daycare can help bring them out of their shell and become more comfortable around new dogs and new people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn05.zipify.com/X2JXFVjgVpR6CRsZREguqi86lDo=/fit-in/3840x0/33ac3e7a5cc84f99b2e03da08fbc897f/adobestock_89358763.jpeg\" alt=\"Dogs Play Fighting | Everything You Need to Know &ndash; Skipper\'s Pet Products\"></p>\r\n<h2>2. Introduces Dogs To New Environments&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Regular attendance at daycare can help dogs find their confidence, which in turn allows them to be comfortable in new environments. Often, the reason a dog is nervous or anxious is because they are unfamiliar with their surroundings. Think of it like a new kid at a new school&mdash;the more time they spend there, the more comfortable they become. Dogs are just like children,&nbsp;and with a little bit of time and patience,&nbsp;they will realize being away from mom or dad at daycare is actually really fun!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>3.&nbsp;Provides A Safe Place For Dogs To Play&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p>One of our highly trained Canine Coaches will always be in the playroom to supervise the dogs playing. Canine Coaches undergo extensive training to learn and prepare for a variety of situations within the playrooms. The team is well-versed in dog body language, safe play, positive reinforcement techniques, and so much more. While your dog is spending the day at Dogtopia, you can find comfort in that your dog is receiving extra love from our Canine Coaches in your absence!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Plus, while at Dogtopia, dogs play on rubberized flooring, which was specifically picked to ease dogs&rsquo; joints and paws.&nbsp;Dogtopia&rsquo;s playrooms were designed to keep dogs safe while allowing them to play the day away in a safe manner!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/sfnkq8lmu5d7/2LUZAR1nyO0sZJC0nqL5cU/80275803d53b895ebe46cd57fb983e9d/2021-11-18_Is_Your_Dog-s_Rough_Play_Appropriate_.jpg\" alt=\"Is Your Dog\'s Rough Play Appropriate? &middot; The Wildest\"></p>\r\n<h2><strong>4.&nbsp;Reduces Anxiety&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Separation anxiety is a normal emotion for dogs who are not adjusted to spending time away from their parents. Dogs may display anxiety with a variety of signs and symptoms, such as increased barking or reactivity of any kind, aggression, chewing, increased personal grooming, onset of destructive behaviors, drooling, panting, or urinating in the house.</p>\r\n<p>When you leave home without your dog, they should understand you will return to give them attention without the concern of being left behind. Dog daycare at Dogtopia is a great way for your pup to get out of the house and learn that spending time away from mom or dad isn&rsquo;t so bad. The more frequent their visits to daycare, the faster they&rsquo;ll adjust and the less likely they&rsquo;ll be to exhibit anxious behavior.</p>\r\n<p>When dogs become regular daycare attendees, social anxiety is reduced because pups understand Dogtopia is a place for playing with their friends and their parents will always return for them!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>5.&nbsp;Play In Any Weather Condition&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Can&rsquo;t go for a walk around the neighborhood because of the weather? Our indoor playrooms are always the perfect temperature.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dogtopia is a great way to maintain your dog&rsquo;s exercise schedule regardless of sun, rain, or even snow! If you live in an area with extreme or inconsistent weather conditions, bringing your dog to Dogtopia allows your dog to stick to a routine full of playtime and exercise regardless of the weather outside. With temperature-controlled playrooms, dogs will always feel cool and comfortable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2><strong>6.&nbsp;A Home Away From Home&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n<p>When your dog attends daycare on a regular basis, they will understand that daycare is where they play with their BFFFs, and their parents will be back soon to pick them up!</p>\r\n<p>Did you know that having your dog spend time at daycare gets them ready for an overnight stay?&nbsp;Sometimes, dogs find themselves a little bit uncomfortable and anxious when spending the night in a new place, especially away from their parents. When your dog attends daycare regularly, they will get to know their surroundings and feel more comfortable with more exposure. Plus, they&rsquo;ll associate time spent at Dogtopia as fun and exciting. So, whether your dog is spending the day or a longer duration&nbsp;of time while you&rsquo;re on vacation, Dogtopia is a comfortable environment for them and their home away from home.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To get all pups ready to spend the night, Dogtopia recommends dogs come to play at daycare for a minimum of three days before any overnight stay. This eliminates the anxiety around going to a &ldquo;new&rdquo; place and allows the dog to feel happy, safe, and comfortable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pups enjoy spending time with their BFFFs, and soon they&rsquo;ll be begging to go back to Dogtopia!

Three attributes should be kept in mind when considering adopting a dog into a family home: temperament, size, and energy level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Temperament&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>A dog&rsquo;s temperament directly translates to their personality. When looking for a dog to bring into your family, you should look for a dog who has a temperament that works best with younger, smaller children. For example, a calm dog will create a stronger bond with your children than a more outgoing, hyper dog.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Size&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Size will not determine if a dog will be good with children, but it will be something to consider in relation to temperament and energy level. A larger, energetic dog may not be the best fit because they may knock over children in a moment of excitement. However, a small, calm dog may work perfectly due to their size and personality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Energy Level&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Energy level is dependent upon your family&rsquo;s preference. If your family is outgoing, energetic, and constantly on the move, an energetic dog breed may be an ideal fit for your family. High-energy dog breeds will require more exercise and movement. If these characteristics are not regularly catered to, your dog may experience behavior problems down the road to release their excess energy. For families who operate at a slower pace, a more casual, low-energy breed might be a great fit instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://unionlakepetservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/baby-3858285_1280-1080x675.jpg\" alt=\"Kids and Dogs: Be Smart, Play Safe &ndash; Union Lake Pet Services\"></p>\r\n<h3>1. Best Dog Breeds For Families With Children</h3>\r\n<h3><strong>Golden Retriever</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>The golden retriever is one of the most patient, smart, and loyal dog breeds which makes them a perfect fit for families with children. This breed does need quite a bit of exercise and they love to play. Children love golden retrievers because of their obedient and affectionate personalities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Beagle&nbsp;</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Beagles are ideal for families with children because not only are they gentle and loving, they also are avid entertainers and love to put on a show. The energy level of a beagle is high which means they will love spending their time running around with kids all day!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Labrador Retriever</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>The Labrador retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds. They are playful, protective, reliable, and highly intelligent. Labrador retrievers take well to training which makes them a great breed for homes with families and smaller children. Before adopting a Labrador retriever, it is important to note this breed requires a lot of exercise and they do shed which will require regular cleanup. Labrador retrievers get along well with other animals and people which makes them one of the more adaptable and hospitable breeds perfect for families.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</strong>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>For a slower-paced family, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a great match. This breed is incredibly friendly and enjoys smaller children and other furry companions.

Bringing A New Dog Into Your Home&nbsp;</h2>\r\n<p>Whenever a new dog is brought into a new place, there may be an adjustment period. This is normal and allows them to learn and understand their new surroundings. Create a schedule with your new pup and abide by it daily to create a sense of routine. This can include playtime, downtime, and time spent together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Appropriate exercise and socialization can be the trickiest elements to incorporate into a daily routine.

As the temperatures rise, most people and their pups spend more time outside attempting to beat the heat in a variety of ways. Does your dog love to be outside? Here are a few key items to keep an eye out for to ensure your dog remains safe and cool in the summer months.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>1. Sunburns&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Did you know dogs can get sunburned? Dogs with thinner hair and lighter skin are more susceptible to sunburning on a sunny day. To avoid sunburns, make regular visits to the shade or indoors. Ask your veterinarian about dog-approved sunscreen options or invest in protective clothing which will allow your pup to be shielded from the sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://c0.wallpaperflare.com/preview/541/753/101/united-states-san-francisco-tracy-swimming-pool.jpg\" alt=\"united states, san francisco, tracy, swimming pool, golden retriever, HD wallpaper\"></p>\r\n<h3>2. Staying Hydrated&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>With any kind of play or exercise, it is important to replenish&nbsp;our bodies with water to stay cool and hydrated, dogs are no different! In the summertime, it is especially important to always have a clean and full water bowl available to your dog throughout the day and for post-play water breaks. Dehydration becomes a bigger problem when the temperature begins to rise, but this is easily avoidable with access to fresh water for your pup. Reminder: be mindful of the water bowl. If the dish begins to look hazy or dirty, replace the water in the bowl. Water bowls should be washed once every day to eliminate any debris or bacterial buildup.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>3. Water Safety&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>If you live near a pool, lake, or ocean, playing in water is a great way to stay cool during the warm summer months. Before jumping in with your dog, check the source of water to ensure it is clean, clear, and free of debris. Dogs who are unfamiliar with water may be a little hesitant to jump right in. Rather than picking them up and placing them in an unknown situation, allow them to become comfortable at their own pace. Enticing them with treats and praise will make the new area more interesting and feel less unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When having fun in&nbsp;water, it can be easy to forget&nbsp;the onset of symptoms of overexposure to sunlight and dehydration. Taking breaks from the sun is crucial during warm summer months and your pup will thank you for it. Once inside or in the comfort of shade, be sure to rehydrate with fresh water for you and your pup.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After a day of play in any form of water, a bath may alleviate built up dirt and bacteria and keep your dog&rsquo;s skin moisturized.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://www.pawsrehab.net/uploads/1/2/3/5/12354094/img-8490-edited-2_1_orig.jpg\" alt=\"Picture\"></p>\r\n<h3>4. Inside Time&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Summer weather means a warmer temperature and longer daylight hours. Your pup may love soaking up the summer sun, but heightened temperatures require more concern when it comes to dehydration and sun exposure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rather than playing outside for an extended period of time or during peak sunlight hours, take your dog for their daily walk either before the sun rises too high in the sky or just as the sun sets. An easy way to tell if it&rsquo;s too hot for your dog is the seven second test. Place your hand on the concrete or asphalt for seven seconds. If you cannot keep your hand on the surface for a consistent seven seconds, it is too hot for your dog to be walking outside. Daily exercise is still important, even in extreme weather conditions, which is why pet parents may want to adjust their schedule during the summer months to keep their pups safe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If your pup needs more play but your schedule does not allow early morning or evening walks or you&rsquo;re in an area where it&rsquo;s still too hot for a walk around the block, schedule your dog for a day of daycare at your local Dogtopia! They will love playing all day long inside our indoor playrooms! Plus, we&rsquo;ll introduce them to plenty of BFFFs (Best Furry Friends Forever) and come home tuckered out, ready for a long night&rsquo;s rest. While they are playing with their BFFFs, they will not only get plenty of exercise, but will also work on their social skills they can show off at home.
